      I ended up watching most of the latter part of the video. I personally found it really interesting and I think the EDA culture will be a good fit based on my educational background. Long story...won't go into it here. But the learning by exampler or by experimentation I feel works really well for me. <br>

        I think I'm going to really enjoy learning in this environment, especially so due to not having been in a learning environment like this for a while now and just looking forward to learning and playing with new toy's, er tool's.
