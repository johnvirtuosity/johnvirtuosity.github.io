            According the the Grecorc Thinking Style test, I am skewed toward being a 'Concrete Random thinking style'. An experimenter!. I guess on reflection I feel this is pretty accurate. 
          </p>
          <p>I'm hoping this will lend itself to the EDA style of learning, as much of the work in the challenges so far involve experimentation. Having said that, I need to make sure I temper the natural desire to experiment with the need to stay on focus with tasks that may not be as much fun but still need to be completed. To achieve this I create daily task-list of achievable task's and tick them off as I go along, which then makes me feel I'm allowed to experiment</p>
          <p>This is reinforced with my enjoyment of phase 0 where the challenges introduce content new or otherwise and then encourage playing and experimenting with what what delivered to cement the concepts, at least at a conscious competence level. </p></article>
          <p>I probably find the reflection's at this point to be the challenging part rather than the technical content, as I treat the technical challenges blocks of skills and knowledge to be learned, whereas the reflections are more about how I felt while completing the challenge.</p>
          <p>I had read about the growth and fixed mindset's previously, I went through a stage of reading lots of self-help type publications a while back, so was not surprised to see how the growth mindset is encouraged at EDA!. The growth mindset seems to be a really good fit for the EDA style.
