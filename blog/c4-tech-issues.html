        <article><h2>Waste not want not - Re-purposing smartphones that are being upgraded for newer models</h2>
        	<p>
            One problem facing the tech industry today is the mountain of smart devices that are being discarded each year just because there is a newer, shinier model out that the manufacturer has to sell.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The problem is that these smart devices are probably mostly fully functional still. This problem is probabaly not restricted to smart devices, but electronic devices and appliances in general.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The difference with the smart devices that are being discarded is that they are perfect for re-purposing to fulfil their true destiny as the very small re-programmable computing devices they were designed to be.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
             Not only do these smartphones provide a platform for running custom applications, but most of them will have camera's, WiFi, Bluetooth, touch screen's, microphones, speakers, gyro's and accelerometers, and many will have GPS as well.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Basically, the smartphones can hear, talk, see, know whether they are in motion, know where they are, and feel....ok this last point might be a bit optimistic!, but thats a lot of technology, just being binned.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            These devices could be used a application platform's that can make use of their special hardware and small size and robustness, no moving parts makes them ideal for harsh environments or environments where mechanical shock is a possibility.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            This re-purposing would serve 2 ends;
            <ul>
              <li>
                Saving more electronic devices just being dumped
              </li>
                Providing low-cost alternatives for some of the devices they are being re-purposed for 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <br>

          <p>
            Some possible applications for re-purposed smartphones.
            <ul>
              <li>Home security. camera. phone. internet access, accelerometer</li>
              <li>Remote controls. TV's stereos, garages. Bluetooth, Wifi</li>
              <li>Door-bells, with video built in, touch-screen for button</li>
              <li>Home automation controllers</li>
              <li>Intercom systems, via WiFi</li>
              <li>Weather stations, with appropriate sensors attached</li>
              <li>Earthquake sensors, with accelerometer, GPS</li>
              <li>House flooding sensors, with SMS notifications</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

            About the author : My early background is in electronics design and I have a passion in automation, home and commercial, as well as robotics and general tinkering, this sort of re-purposing really interest's me. I have had experience writing applications for mobile devices and accessing the various sensors available with smartphones is surprisingly not that difficult.
