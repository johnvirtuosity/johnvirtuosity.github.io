        <article><h2>My Experiences with pairing and feedback, as at week 5 phase 0.</h2>
        	<p>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</p>
          <p>
            I had some prior experience with pairing to solve challenges previously and the pairing sessions I have had so far were very enjoyable. Programming generally raises numerous way of solving a problem, but everyone approaches things slightly differently so it was interesting to let that process run it's natural course, rather that have to rush to find a solution because the client needs it to work like , yesterday!!..
          </p>
          <h3>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</h3>
          <p>
            I enjoy the process of solving problems, and once my pair and I had established the problem to be solved most enjoyed the attempt to refactor something to 'm very much the 
          </p> 
          <h3>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</h3>
            <p>
              The thing I found most frustrating was more around the level of my instant recall of the Ruby syntax at this stage, and I would probably describe the feeling in terms of a speaker of a new language, where they know there is a word that can express the idea they have in their head, but they keep having to go to the dictionary to find the word. This will come in time with practice but it is frustrating to me at the time.
            </p>
            <p>The conversation is ultimately satisfying but a bit stilted. Thankfully, the pairing I have had so far took this into account and made it less awkward.</p>
          <p>
            Part of this also may be due to the nature of remote pairing.
          </p>  

        <h3>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</h3>
        <p>
          The initial reading of the feedback is not necessarily the best feeling, which may be a reflection of my expectation that it's going to be bad news. Working on just trying to read the feedback objectively.
        </p>
        <h3>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, the feedback I have received has helped with subsequent my pairing sessions.
        </p>

        <h3>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</h3>
        <p>The feedback from my first pairing session was very helpful in identifying something I have taken into subsequent pairing sessions and that was to not feel like I had to keep the conversation going.</p>

        <h3>How was it to write feedback?</h3>
-         <p>I have informally paired previously, but had never had to provide any formal feedback on that experience, other than the standards high-fives, pats on the back and celebratory drinks after having found a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          My approach in the past was to give feedback only when there was something that went really wrong during a pairing session. I have not found that to be the case at this stage of my pairings.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</h3>
        <p>Most likely due to my innate personality, I found the most difficult part of writing feedback was trying to come up with some constructive feedback I could give. I don't feel qualified at this stage in the course to comfortably venture feedback that might be useful.</p>

        <h3>
          Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I like the pairing process. The formal pairing is a great way for everyone to get their chance to learn from the shared problem-solving process.
