        <p>Stereo-type threat</p>
        <article><h2>My experience with stereo-type threat</h2>
        	<p>
            AGE-ism, or ASIAN-ism ???

            Using mindfulness techniques, firstly is the stereotype threat perceived or real

            If the threat is real, then it would be fair to raise it and try to resolve it

            If the threat is perceived, which can seems to be more common than it might seem, then I would employ some of the mindfulness techniques to gain some perspective on the the threat and try to manage the voices in my head that may be behaving in a counter-productive way.

            The research into this topic has shown how powerful the mind can be in both a positive way,but also how destructive it can be also.
