        <p>Stereo-type threat</p>
        <article><h2>My personal experience with stereo-type threat</h2>
        	<p>
            As an immigrant asian, I found myself experiencing, though I had no name for it until researching it recentlt, stereo-type threat based around the asian communities perceived expectation that asian students follow an orderly learning approach at school, and that they should do well at school.<br>

            I had a rather more experimental style of learning which did not always score well when it came to exam's that were designed to guage student ability.<br>

            What I learned later in life was that the problem with this standard testing approach was that it was measuring purely what you knew on the day, rather than your ability to learn. This had me feeling like I was not as good at school as my community.<br>

            For me, this meant that if I didn't score well in an exam I was not intelligent, and therefore did not fit well into the group I associated myself with. This had a negative effect on my self-view and I also found myself using the 'oh it's only a piece of paper' argument to justify to myself that it was ok for me not to be 'intelligent'.<br>

            This added further pressure and stress to exam situations, which realistically should not have.<br>

            What I found out later in life when I returned to studies as an adult student, was that I now related to a different group, that being the adult-learner group. <br>

            In a country that favours those prepared to have a go and show persistant and grit, these qualities are things to aspire to and , thankfully, the adult-learner group to a great extent has that in spades. <br>

            So I found myself experiencing the positive side of associating strongly with a group where the stereo-type has a positive effect on those that identify with it. I found small a achievement led to massive confidence gain and this led to further achievements. The interesting thing about the achievement's were that they were entirely for my own benefit, to satisfy my desire to learn. Rather than necessarily for me to satisfy the community's view on what I should be.   <br>

            What I discovered through that process was that despite the feeling I am being judged in some way, for the most part people are very willing to offer help and guidance without judging.<br>

            What I tend to do if I find someone may be feeling some form of stereo-type threat is to treat them as normally as possible, make it clear they are seen as all part of the same shared group without making it feel like I am being patronising. i.e. Try to is to let any person that may be showing some <br>
