        <article><h2>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h2>
          <p><h3>Exploring your values</h3></p>
        	<p>The common feeling's I experience when I am happiest most often have involved many of the following values:
            <ol>
              <li>Accomplishment</li>
              <li>Compassion</li>
              <li>Confidence</li>  
              <li>Commitment</li>
              <li>Having a family</li>
              <li>Integrity</li>
              <li>Self-reliance</li>
            </ol>

            <br><br>
            In general, I try to live up to these values:<br><br>
            Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- <ul>4</ul> ----- 5 Agree
            <br><br>

            With some of the events I have experienced in the past I would say that commitment has led up to many of the other values. My personal belief is that very often the effort and commitment lead to many of the more meaningful values.

            As a parent, commitment is one value I try to stress to my kids. Sometimes this can tend to get lost amongst the focus on just getting everything right.

            <p><h3>Advice</h3></p><br>
            <h3>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</h3><br>
            <p>
              The last topic that someone asked me for advice on was a series of home-improvement tasks

            <p><h3>Values and Stereotype threat</h3></p><br>
            <p>How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?
            </p>
            <p><h3>Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at EDA?<h3></P><br>
            <p>I have been practicing 'mindfulness' for a while now since being directed to it several years ago. I found it extremely useful in times when I'm feeling a bit down.
