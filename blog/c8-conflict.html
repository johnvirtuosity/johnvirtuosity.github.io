        <article><h2>Conflict resolution</h2>
        	<p>Recently, I have had a chance to experience a conflict which involved who was to use an allocated parking space.</p>
          <p>The situation was that there were 3 allocated parking spaces, but depending on the size of car only 2 could park comfortably, if parked as the lines on the carpark would suggest.</p>
          <p>My initial reaction was one of 'look, you guys, just sort it out. What's the big deal?, just fix it.'</p>
          <p>Interestingly, things did not sort themselves out. So a bit of effort was then put in to calm the situation down and ask the parties if they were prepared to park at a different angle from the lines on the carpark to determine if it was even possible to fit the 3 cars in at all simultaneously.</p>
          <p>In this instance, I had the opportunity to act as a mediator to this conflict which took away the personal emotion side of things. For me, this helped in finding a resolution to the problem.</p>
          <p>It turned out that a re-alignment of the parking angle for the 3 cars meant that they could all fit. This solved the technical part of the problem. Being able to show some interest and empathy to each party though meant that all parties were prepared to change their initial position in the conflict to try and come to a compromise that made the situation workable.</p>
          <p>Ultimately all conflict is initially brought on by parties that have an expectation of other parties that have differing expectations. Conflicts escalate when neither party will consider the other parties views.</p>
          <p>This experience showed me that some of the heat of a conflict is generated not by the actual reason for the conflict, in this case can all 3 cars be parked in their parks at the same time, but an un-related and un-spoken need to be considered and listened to and not dismissed out of hand, which is often what happens when conflicts get out of hand.</p>
          <p>Sometime's it is better to address conflicts after objectively, at least as possible, after letting some heat out of the situation and then discussing the problem without the heat.</p>
          <p>This may not always be possible, as compromise by some or all of the parties involved will always be required, but it's a good starting point.</p>
