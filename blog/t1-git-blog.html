  <h2>An overview of using a version control in your software project</h2>

      It is highly likely during the course of a software project that there will be many changes to your work, over time. It is not often you get it perfect the first time around.<br><br>

      With this in mind, imagine what would happen if you realised that after 5 days of programming you found your code did not work correctly the way it did on day 3, but by now you've already made lots of changes and added lots more code, but can't remember everything you did in the last 2 day's!.<br><br>

      What do you do?!, start again?!.<br><br>

      Thankfully, if you had used some form of version control system during the 5 days of coding, you may not need to. <br><br>

      Version control system's enable you to store copies of your changed files at a point in time. Imagine it like a 'snapshot' of your code, frozen in time for you to refer to if necessary later.<br><br>

      The basic idea is that at the end of each day of coding, or after any work you want to be able to return without losing all work after that point, you take a 'snapshot' of your code using your version control system.<br><br>

      So, in the example above, at the end of day 1 you take a snapshot copy of your code, lets call that version 1, at the end of day 2 you take another snapshot copy of your code, call that version 2 and repeat this process at the end of each day. <br><br>

      Half way through day 5 when you realise your current code is not performing correctly, you remember that when you tested in on day 3 things were all sweet. At this point you can use your version control system to restore your system to its state as it was on day 3, version 3, but also preserve the copies of your code for day 4 and day 5, versions 4 and 5, enabling you to work out what's not working in your day 4 and day 5 version's of your code.<br><br>

      The important benefit of a version control system is that you are able to restore a working copy of your code at a known point in time, or version, without losing changes made after that point in time, subsequent versions.<br> <br>

    <p>
        One of the most popular version control systems in use by software developers is called 'git'. Git enables you to store copies locally (on your computer drive) of files that you have changed that you choose to group together as a version of those files. <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
       GitHub, is an internet based service that git can copy it's changed files to in a thing called a 'repository'.<br><br>

       As GitHub is able to accessed via the internet by other developers it enables the version of code you copy up to the GitHub repository to also be accessed, if you choose to let them access it, by other developers.<br><br>

       Think of GitHub as a central library of your's and other developers code files that you and other can 'check out', make changes to, and then check back in like a library book. <br><br>
