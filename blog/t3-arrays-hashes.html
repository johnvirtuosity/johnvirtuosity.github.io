          <article><h2>Array's vs Hashes</h2>
          	<p>An arrays is a indexed collection of elements. The elements can be all of any type of object, like strings, numbers, but could be other type of objects also. Arrays are indexed by sequential numbers only enabling you to refer to the element by its index number. Imagine series of numbered boxes, each box holding word. If you wanted to know what the word in box number 3 is you would, in english say 'tell me what is in box number 3', simple enough. You can refer to any of the boxes by their box number.</p>
            <p>A hash, is also a collection of elements. The elements can also be any type of object. The elements in a hash though consist of the object to be stored as well as a key element. Hashes store things in pairs, the pair consisting of a key and the object.</p>
            <p>The primary difference with array's and hashes is that with a hash you can choose yourself what you want the indexed key to be, that being the first element of the pair, whereas an with an array the index number is assigned to the object to be stored when it is added the array.</p>
