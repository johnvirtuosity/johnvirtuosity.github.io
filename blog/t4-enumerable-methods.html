        <p>Ruby Enumerable Methods</p>
        <article><h2>Enumerable#map, Enumerable#group_by, Enumerable#cycle</h2>
        	<p>'Enumerable' is a set of operations, called 'methods', that enable you to look at each value or item in an array or comma separated list of items or values or a mixture of both, and take each of these item's or values and do something based on the item or value, the action performed on the original value is defined in a 'block' which is included when executing one of the 'Enumerable' methods, which are then used to generate a new array of these items or values.</p>

          <p>Enumerable#map is one of the methods 'Enumerable' can perform. #map, takes an array, looks at each of the values or items and perform's an operation on each value in the array (list of items) passed to it, and return's the new value, the new value may just be the value original value unchanged. #map then generates a new array consisting of the new values. In this case the original array is unchanged, a new array is generated and you end up with the original array and a new array of values or items.</p>

          <p>Enumerable#map, can perform an operation on the original value and based on some condition defined, return a value that is completely different from the original value.</p>

          <p>There is also, a 'map!' method which enables you to change the original array values instead of generating a new array.
          </p>

          <p>Here are some example's of the '#map' method...</p>
          <br>
          <code>
              original_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
              new_array = Array.new()

              new_array = original_array.map { |n| n * n } , the 'n * n' is the block that operates on each value'

              new_array now contains [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]
          </code>
          <br>

          <p>Enumerable#group_by is another one of the methods 'Enumerable' can perform. #group_by, takes an array and using the grouping defined in the 'block' groups the values and returns a hash table with the array values now groupedf, with the key displaying the group value.</p>

          <p>Here are some example's of the '#group_by' method...</p>
          <br>
          <code>
              original_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
              new_hash = Hash.new()

              new_hash = original_array.group_by { |v| v.odd? } , the 'n * n' is the block that operates on each value'

              new_hash now contains {true=>[5, 1, 3], false=>[4, 6, 2]}
              the array values are now grouped by whether or not they were odd numbers, this was defined in the block by the 'v.odd?' 
          </code>
          <br>
          <p>Enumerable#cycle is yet another one of the methods 'Enumerable' can perform. The #cycle method takes an array and returns the array value by value as many time's as is defined when the #cycle method is called. 
          </p>
          <p>Here are some example's of the '#cycle' method...</p>
          <br>
          <code>
              original_array = [a,b,c,1,2,3]

              original_array.cycle(3) {|v| puts v} 'puts outputs the value to the console'

              would return a,b,c,1,2,3,a,b,c,1,2,3 (original array cycled through 2 times each time returning each value in the array)
          </code>
          <br>
          <p>The chaining or combination of methods enables you to complete very complex array or list manipulation and filtering if needed.</p>
