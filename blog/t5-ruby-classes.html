        <article><h2>Classes - huh! what are they good for!!.. Absolutely everything!..</h2>
        	<p>
            Classes, in programming are a used as a way grouping of actions that a class can perform along with the data (attributes or properties that tell us something about the class) that the actions are performed on. This is called 'encapsulation'. This encapsulation, means we don't have methods and attributes for the same object spread all over the place in your code. This makes for easier maintenance and eliminates duplication of code amongst other things.
          </p>         

          <p>
            If we consider we humans as a class, then each person is an 'instance' of the class of humans. When we were created, we each shared many common traits and behaviours and physical attributes, not necessarily each one identical to another person's but very similar.

          This relate's to classes construct in programming very well.

          If we took this analogy further then, physical attributes relate to the attributes and properties of a class, so eyes, hair,hair length, height, gender, ethnicity, nose-shape etc. Attributes are what defines appearance to the outside world.

          Our behaviours, might be we can 'say something', we can 'hold something', we can 'eat something', we can 'work out a maths problem', 'shut your eyes', so our behaviours are 'actions' we can perform. These 'actions' relate to the 'methods' of a class</p>

          <p>
            When you want to use a class, you first of all need to create an 'instance' of the class. The class serves as a template for the instance of the class. You can compare this to the conception and birth of person, though it's really more like 'cloning' a person.
          </p>

          <p>
            The great thing about classes is that they enable you to create a template for the object you want to model and from then on make copies from that template. This is called 'inheritance'. This eliminates or reduces much duplication of code as when you want to change an attribute or method for all instances of a class, you just need to make the change in the class, and when instances are created they all inherit that change. No need to make the change in each instance manually.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why aren't classes just used everywhere then ?. The use of classes may require a bit more planning up front, and so on smaller systems, this may be seen as more effort than is required to achieve the desired result. As projects scale up though, that's when the extra work up front will come into it's own by enabling complex system to be more easily changed, maintained and scaled up.

          <p>
            Taking the analogy further, some of the properties of a human class might include...
          </p>

          <p>
            <ol>
               <li>legs (states might be 'bent', 'straight','broken')</li>
               <li>arms (states might be 'stretched up', 'bent')</li>
               <li>eyes(states might be 'opened', 'closed')</li>
               <li>mouth (states might be 'opened', 'closed')</li>            
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            some of the methods of a human class might include...
          </p>

          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>say (what to say)</li>
              <li>walk (direction and distance)</li>
              <li>listen (start or stop)</li>
              <li>work out a maths problem( here is the problem to solve)</li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <p>
            I am working on creating a working example of my 'human' class, virtual as it may be..Watch this space...
